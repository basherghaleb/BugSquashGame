# BugSquashGame
A fun Bug Squash Game using C++ &amp; wxWidgets

# About
A bug-squashing game was developed using pre-configured XML files that define the types and
locations of bugs through traversal. The game includes features such as varying bug types, 
which can be edited through a code editor dialog pop-up. Clicking on a specific bug type demonstrates
code redundancy by generating a random number of additional bugs of the same bug type. The game incorporates
a scoreboard with three categories: hit, miss, and oops, where "oops" means a specific bug type being clicked. 
Additionally, the project includes a custom level featuring a final boss bug with a health bar. Test-driven 
development was employed to ensure efficient and effective functionality throughout the game and the
development of the project.
